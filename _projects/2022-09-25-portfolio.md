I recently converted my old website, based on Gatsby.js, to Jekyll which is the website you're viewing now! I've experimented with many tools and web frameworks over the years: barebones HTML and CSS, React, Ghost and many pre-built Jekyll templates, however I've finally settled on a hand-made design I'm happy with. The site is extensible enough to support a larger amount of content and is significantly easier to maintain than before.
